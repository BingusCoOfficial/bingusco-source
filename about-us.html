            <h1>About BingusCO!</h1>

            <h3>The Company</h3>

            BingusCO is a software company dedicated to creating the future of tech.
            With operating systems, antivirus softwares, internet browsers and so much more! But thats not all! We also have games and tools to help you online and offline!

            <h3>People's Thoughts</h3>

            While people suspect our company and softwares to be a scam and malware, they are not. We are a genuine software company trying to sell our products. Not all products will be paid for such as the antivirus (BingusWare), but you can upgrade to an advanced version for a small fee. Software such as the operating system (Wyvern) take time to make which is why we will add a paywall in front of it.

            <h3>Insider Development System</h3>

            You can sign up to be an BingusCO Insider to test Alphas and Betas of WIP software, but leaking any of the features / GUIs will cause a termination of your insider permit and maybe even a lawsuit.

            <h3>Jobs</h3>

            As written above you can sign up for the Insider Development System and see Alphas and Betas, but dont think that is all you can do! You can apply for jobs such as: Graphic Designer, Coder, Ideator, Actor, Assistant and so so so much more. To sign up you will have to join our Discord server at discord.gg/epYby84uZU, create a ticket in the server and we will look at the experience and qualifications that you have sent over and we will give you the email and the application form. You should send your completed form to the email given when applying for the job, once done, you will either get a call or a message/text from our agents for a further interview. Information on what to add will be given to you. Examples being: qualifications, experience and skill.

            <h3>Help and Support</h3>

            For help and support you can email us your questions/issues but an email back is not guaranteed. You could also go to the forums page where you can ask a question and other people not only agents can try to answer your questions. If none of these help you, you can try the live chat page, where you can get live tech support from an agent, right in your web browser. Please note that an agent will not always be available due a shortage of employees at this moment in time.

            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>

            Due to the lack of employees as said above, we are unable to create deadlines for software releases because we do not the exact date and time. Our budget is growing and we are attempting to hire people. You can apply using the information above. Joining will give you a small pay. Currently we have a different way of paying, we are NOT paying by the hour, we are paying by the work you do.
